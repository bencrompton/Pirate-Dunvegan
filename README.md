Pirate Dunvegan is a swashbuckling tale in rhyming couplets that follows Dunvegan as he escapes from the confines of the book he is in, and then merrily goes about the business of looting and pillaging children in the real world. Suddenly, the pirate spots several children's heads, floating like hot air balloons in the sky. It dawns on him that he is a character in the picture book that the children are reading. After a brief existential crisis... 


**Pirate Dunvegan’s Escape From This Book**

"I'm the King of the Ocean, and Lord of the Sea!

The dreaded Pirate Dunvegan be me!



Got a beard full of fleas and a head full of lice

My voice is not pretty, my breath is not nice

  


Off the plank with the cook, for burning my meat!

To the sharks with the watchman, for taking my seat!

 

Off the..."

 

“Oi!” called a voice like the squeak of a gate

It was Cutlas, old Pirate Dunvegan’s first mate

 

“What now?” roared the pirate king, “out with it, chum,

Is it mice in the mainsail? Or rats in the rum?

 

"None of that," stammered Cutlas, "no word of a lie,

But there’s huge kiddies heads floating high in the sky

 

“Up there,” Cutlas pointed, "you must have a look

I’m afraid what it means is we’re all in a book."

 

Dunvegan looked up, and to his surprise,

The heads of you kiddies near filled up the skies

 

"Great Snot!" cried the pirate, "We are in a book!"

“You’re famous,” said Cutlas, “just like Captain Hook!

 

Dunvegan grew quiet as he thought of his life

Was he real? Could he know? And what of his wife?

 

The spotty and dotty miss Lottie McGoo

“I see they've trapped lamb chop inside this book too!”

 

The pirate, he raged, shook his fist in the air

And he yelled at you kids, like a grumpy au pair

 

“What do you miserable brats want from me?

Let me pirate in peace, close the book, let me be!"

 

But then from behind all you sweet girls and boys

That smelly old pirate, he spotted some toys

 

"Oh-ho!" said Dunvegan, "I see loot galore

Sweets by the bedside and toys on the floor!

 

I’m stuck in this book, but I promise you dears,

I'm as real as the wax in your pink little ears

 

I’ll break through this page and I'll come for your loot

And your sweeties and baubles and knickknacks to boot!

 

Mount the ram! Fly the sail! To the oars with the crew!

Give me full speed ahead, there’s a book to break through!

 

The ship, she gained speed, hit the page with a CRASH

"There's a hole!" cried Dunvegan, “a crack, and a gash!"

 

Them kiddies is squeelin', we'll get them, by jove!

Now backs to the oars, and more coal on the stove!"

 

Again boys, and faster, once more and we’re in!

Them kids’ll be sorry,” he said with a grin.

 

But the pirate ship slowed to the pace of a snail

“What now?” roared Dunvegan, “No wind in the sail?”

 

“It's not that,” Cutlas yelled, “it’s them kids, they’re too clever

they won’t turn the page, we’ll be stuck here forever!

 

The pirate king smiled and he batted his eye

"Oh, do turn the page, children, don’t make me cry”

 

I was joking, of course, about stealing the toys

of you brave little girls and you sweet little boys

 

You, little one, turn the page, be a dear

It's grampy Dunvegan, there’s nothing to fear!

 

[The last page shows fearsome Pirate Dunvegan's ship crashing through the page, loaded with pirates, ready to pillage toys and candy.]

 

So if there’s a truck you’ve not seen for a while

Or a dolly that’s out of her place in the pile

 

If a sweet that went missing, turns up less a bite

Or the bath mat gets wet in the dead of the night

 

It could be your brother or uncle or mom

It might be your gran or your dog Bubblegum

 

But don’t be surprised if you find that the crook

Is Pirate Dunvegan, who escaped from this book!
